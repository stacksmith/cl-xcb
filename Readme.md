# CL-XCB

This is an experimental, minimal set of bindings for XCB.  Combined with Freetype2, just enough to output decent antialiased text for texty applications.

## Requirements

In order for CL-XCB to work, your system must have XWindows/XCB libraries and Freetype2 libraries installed.  Many Linux distributions come with these pre-installed, and installing something like the GIMP will probably do the trick.

## Quick Start


## Configuring with .lemrc
## STATUS 
Just working...

## Notes:

### Hacking

### Debug information

See xcb/global.lisp.
Set `*xbug*` t and recompile for debug output.
Set `*compile-checked*` and recompile for checked XCB calls.
